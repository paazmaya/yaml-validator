[Yaml](http://yaml.org/) files are parsed via [`js-yaml`](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml)
and the structure defined in the configuration options is enforced with
[`check-type`](https://github.com/alistairjcbrown/check-type).

## Getting Started

Please note that the minimum supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is `10.13.0`, which is [the active Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

This tool can be used in two ways, either via Node.js script, or as a command line tool.
Note that when used via command line, custom structure cannot be validated.

Installation when used via Node.js script:

```sh
npm install yaml-validator --save-dev
```

Installation when used as a command line tool:

```sh
npm install --global yaml-validator
```

Usage as a part of a Node.js script:

```js
const YamlValidator = require('yaml-validator');

// Default options
const options = {
  log: false,
  structure: false,
  onWarning: null,
  writeJson: false
};

const files = [
  'file paths',
  'that exists',
  'somewhere',
  'and are Yaml files'
];

const validator = new YamlValidator(options);
validator.validate(files);
validator.report();
```

Using via command line tool, the only argument would be the Yaml file which should be validated:

```sh
yaml-validator random_file.yml
```

The available options for command line use, can be seen with the help command `yaml-validator -h`, which results in output similar to:

```sh
yaml-validator [options] <files>

  -h, --help             Help and usage instructions
  -V, --version          Version number
  -w, --write-json       Write the contents of the Yaml file to a JSON file next to it
  -l, --log-file String  Log file where errors are written

Version 2.0.0
```

When used from the command line, the process exits with the number of invalid files.

## Configuration options

All options are `false` by default which disables their use.

### options.log

Type: `string`

Default value: `false`

In case the value is not `false`, the given string will be used as log file where all the
task output is written.


### options.structure

Type: `object`

Default value: `false`

The most complex style of checking validity.


### options.onWarning

Type: `function`

Default value: `null`

One of the options passed to [`safeload` method of `js-yaml`](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml#safeload-string---options-).

Please note that the `onWarning` callback is being used by this library and any method written for it,
will be run after the one implemented in this library.
The callback get called with two parameters, of which the first is the error in question,
while the second is the file path of the given Yaml file.


### options.writeJson

Type: `boolean`

Default: `false`

Write the given Yaml file as pretty printed JSON in the same path, just by changing the file extension to `json`.

Please note that any existing JSON files will be cruelly overwritten.

## Typescript Support

`YamlValidator` ships with its own typing definition in the library, no need to use `@types`.

## Examples

### Structure validation options

In case an array is found, all its members are assumed to have the given structure.
This can be seen in the `classRooms` property, which according to the configuration below,
should be an array, for which all items are objects, which all should have a `name` and `id`
properties, with the given types.

The `teachers` array is made of strings, thus all items in that array must be a string.


```js
const options = {
  structure: {
    school: {
      'description?': 'string', //Optional, won't show in invalid array
      code: 'number',
      principal: {
        name: 'string'
      },
      classRooms: [
        {
          name: 'string',
          id: 'number',
          'location?':{
            floor: "string",
            building: "string",
          }
        }
      ],
      teachers: [
        'string'
      ]
    }
  }
};
```

### Warning callback in Yaml parsing options

Using the `options.onWarning` callback, the possible parsing errors can be retrieved.

```js
const options = {
  onWarning: function (error, filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' has error: ' + error);
  }
};
```

### Write a JSON file option

It is possible to use the `options.writeJson` to have all the files processed,
to be saved in JSON format, in the same file path as the original Yaml files.

```js
const options = {
  writeJson: true
};
```

Linting is done with [ESLint](http://eslint.org) and can be executed with `npm run lint`.
There should be no errors appearing after any JavaScript file changes.

Please note that any features or changed will not be merged without working unit tests.

Unit tests are written with [`tape`](https://github.com/substack/tape) and can be executed with `npm test`.
Code coverage is inspected with [`nyc`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) and
can be executed with `npm run coverage` after running `npm test`.
Please make sure it is over 90% at all times.
